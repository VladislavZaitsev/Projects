## Conclusions

Based on the results of the analysis, 4 segments of banking product users were identified. It was found out that the probability of client churn increases with an increase in the number of products: for example, all owners of 4 products and more than 80% of the owners of 3 products left the bank. Recommendations were made for the bank's management to reduce client churn.
