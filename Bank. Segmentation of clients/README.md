## Project description

The task is to analyze the bank clients and segment them by the number of products, paying special attention to churn.

## Skills & Tools

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* event analytics
* testing of statistical hypotheses
* user segmentation
* data visualization

## Conclusions

Based on the results of the analysis, I identified 4 segments of banking product users. I found out that the probability of client churn rises with an increase in the number of products: for example, all owners of 4 products and more than 80% of the owners of 3 products left the bank. I have made several recommendations for the bank's management to reduce client churn.
