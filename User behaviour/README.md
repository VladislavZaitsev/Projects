## Conclusions

In this project, I built a sales funnel, and explored the path of users to purchase: out of 7419 unique users who participated in the experiment, only 47.7% (3539 users) reach the last step, payment. Most users get stuck when moving from the home screen to the offer screen - 38.1%. The reasons for such a significant drop should be investigated and corrected accordingly.

I analyzed the results of an A/B test for introducing new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. The result of A/A/B testing indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the old and new fonts. Therefore, it is not advisable to make changes to the fonts.
