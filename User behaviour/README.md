## Conclusions

In this project, I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, and explored the path of users to purchase. I analyzed the results of an A/B test for introducing new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It is revealed that the new font does not significantly affect user behaviour.
